# Learning Rust

Here is a list of a few materials it might be worth going over to get an
introduction to Rust:

- [The Rust Book] is one of the best introductions around and worth working
  through to understand most of the concepts.

- [Rust: A Better C++ Than C++] is a good site for those more familiar with
  C/C++ covering the differences of Rust`.

- [`async`] is one of the areas of the language that is still being developed,
  but is core to the STEAM [engine]. Here is an [introductory video covering
  async], and [a more advanced video on async].

- Finally, this is a good video that shows the power of what Rust can do help
  [design a good interface].

It is also worth being aware of [The Rust Playground] which allows you to play
with Rust without installing it locally (like the [Godbolt Compiler Explorer]).
