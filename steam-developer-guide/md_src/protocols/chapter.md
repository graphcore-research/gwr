# Protocols

Protocols represent packet/frame types.

The `steam_protocol` library aims to eventually provide a collection of packet
based protocols to be used when building simulations. These are not intended to
include or model Graphcore IP.

`steam_protocol` also provides the `build_packet_type` macro.
